# PWA Game Gallery

Welcome to the PWA Game Gallery repository! This project is a collection of Progressive Web App (PWA) games developed and contributed by developers and enthusiasts like you. Whether you want to explore fun games or share your own creations, this gallery is the place to be.

## Demo

Check out the live demo of the PWA Game Gallery [here](https://dondido.github.io/flash-store/).

## What is a PWA Game?

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that offer a native app-like experience in a web browser. PWA games leverage web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide interactive and engaging gaming experiences directly in the browser, without the need for downloads or installations.

## Adobe Flash games converted to PWA games

Part of this project is dedicated to bringing classic Flash games back to life as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using the Ruffle emulator. We encourage developers and enthusiasts to contribute by adding more PWA games to the collection. Let's preserve the nostalgia and enjoy these games in modern browsers!
